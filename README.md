# Sample-SQL

In here, I will share what I have learned and understood! 

For the practice, I'm using PostgreSQL!


# I) Data Definition

## Creating schema
Organizing and grouping tables into logical units.
``` sql
CREATE SCHEMA schema_name (other than the public one).
```

## Creating tables 
Create table statement with optional table constraint and default value. The next following SQL command creates a table with all data types available in PostgreSQL.

``` sql
CREATE TABLE table_name (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    name TEXT NOT NULL,
    date DATE,
    time TIME WITH TIME ZONE,
    datetime TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    boolean BOOLEAN,
    decimal NUMERIC,
    real REAL,
    double DOUBLE PRECISION,
    smallint SMALLINT,
    bigint BIGINT,
    blob BYTEA
);
```

This creates a table called example_table with the following columns:

    id: a serial column that is the primary key for the table
    name: a text column that cannot contain a null value
    date: a date column
    time: a time with time zone column
    datetime: a timestamp with time zone column
    timestamp: a timestamp with time zone column
    boolean: a boolean column
    decimal: a numeric column with a decimal precision
    real: a real (floating point) column
    double: a double precision (floating point) column
    smallint: a small integer column
    bigint: a big integer column
    blob: a bytea column for storing binary data

Note that the time, timestamp, and bytea data types are specific to PostgreSQL.

## Creating indexes
Index improves the speed of querying through the table's data.

``` sql
CREATE INDEX idx__name
ON table_name
USING (columns_names)
```

## Creating views
This is an imaginary table
``` sql
CREATE VIEW view_name AS SELECT QUERY
```

## Altering table
If your table is already created and you want to bring some modifications, you can modify it.

- Adding columns

Altering table to add new column(s)
``` sql
ALTER TABLE table_name ADD new_column DataType OptionalTableConstraint DEFAULT default_value; 
```
- Adding constraint (foreign key)

``` sql
ALTER TABLE table_name_1
ADD FOREIGN KEY (id2) REFERENCES table_name_2(id2);
```

- Removing columns

Altering table to remove column(s)
``` sql
ALTER TABLE table_name DROP column_to_be_deleted; 
```

- Renaming the table
Altering table name
``` sql
ALTER TABLE table_name RENAME TO new_table_name; 
```


## Removing table
If you no longer need a table, you can remove it.

``` sql
DROP TABLE table_name;
``` 

# II) Date types

PostgreSQL supports several data types that can be used to store date and time values. 
Here is a list of some of the commonly used date and time data types in PostgreSQL:

- timestamp: Stores a date and time value with UTC by default. For example, it can take the value of '2004-10-19 10:23:54' UTC.

- timestamptz: This is the same as timestamp, but with the time zone included. For example, '2004-10-19 10:23:54+03' this value includes the UTC+3.

- date: Stores only the date (YYYY/MM/DD) without the time.

- time: Stores only the time (HH:MM:SS without time zone) without the date.

- interval: Stores a duration of time, such as the difference between two timestamps. For example, x days HH:MM:SS with time zone.

## Creating a table
/**
 Creates a table called events with columns for :
 - an id (which is a serial type and will be automatically assigned a unique value for each row), 
 - a name (which is a text type and cannot be NULL), 
 - a start_time and end_time (both of which are timestamp with time zone data types and cannot be NULL), 
 - and a duration (which is an interval type and cannot be NULL). <br>
**/

``` sql
CREATE TABLE events (
  id serial PRIMARY KEY,
  name text NOT NULL,
  start_time timestamptz NOT NULL,
  end_time timestamptz NOT NULL,
  duration interval NOT NULL
);
```

## Insert one row. In here, I'm in UTC+3

``` sql
INSERT INTO events (name,start_time,end_time,duration)
VALUES ('New Year party', '2023-01-01 00:23:00+03', current_timestamp,current_timestamp-'2023-01-01 00:23:00+03')
```

## The next Select command shows the value of an interval from the difference between 2 timestamps 
``` sql
SELECT duration FROM events
```

## You can get current time with different types
``` sql
SELECT CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIME, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, LOCALTIME,LOCALTIMESTAMP
```




# III) Data Manipulation

From this part, I use Netflix datasets to practice.

1) Using command line for quering (SELECT)
``` sql
psql postgresql://user@localhost/netflix -H -c 'select * from netflix_titles limit 2;'
``` 
This command :
- connects to the database netflix;
- executes the query select * from netflix_titles limit 2, which means select only 2 rows for all the data from netflix_titles table;
- the parameter -H gets the output in HTML format.

# IV) Psql tips

1) Filling the NULL

For null values, we can fill them with emoji. In here, for example, 
``` sql
psql -U username --dbname netflix -c '\pset border 2' -c '\pset null ü¶ûÔ∏è' -c 'select showid, duration_minutes from netflix_titles limit 5;'
``` 
In single command line, we make access to the database 'netflix', decorate the output with border, assign the emoji for null values, and launch the query.

The output is :

2) Database connection

There are two accepted formats for connection strings

## Plain keyword/value string
``` sql
psql 'user=username host=hostname port=portnumber dbname=dbname'
``` 
## URIs
``` sql
psql postgresql://user:secret@host:port/dbname
```
